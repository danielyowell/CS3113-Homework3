This repo contains a .pdf file of my Homework 3 answers, along with a C file for the final question.

To run the C file:
* Navigate to the file in the terminal
* Enter `gcc -pthread -o threads threads.c` to compile
* Enter `./threads` to run
* Mutual exclusion can be toggled on/off by modifying the `mutual_exclusion` global variable
